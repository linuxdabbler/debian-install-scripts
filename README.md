# debian-install-scripts
scripts to run after installing debian

These scripts are intended for use on a debian linux system

Just because these scripts work for me, does not necessarily mean they will work for you

I will not be held responsible for messing up your system

So PLEASE READ EACH SCRIPT BEFORE RUNNING

These are meant for getting particular software installed after your initial installation of Debian.

My suggestion is to try these scripts in a virtual machine first before running them on your system

Thank you for visiting my github page

NOTE: YOU ONLY HAVE TO RUN SCRIPTS 100 AND 101 IF YOU CREATED A ROOT USER DURING INSTALLATION.

NOTE: after cloning/downloading and unzipping the repository simply run these commands
and they will become executable


cd /debian-install scripts

su

chmod +x *.sh
